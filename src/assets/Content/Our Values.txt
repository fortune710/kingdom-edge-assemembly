What We Believe
We believe we have been commissioned to reach out to everyone regardless of culture, tribe or race. We believe we have been commissioned to reach out to the unchurched, to express God’s true love and care with deep passion for souls, prayer and ministry of the word. We believe we have been commissioned to reach our neighbourhoods and nations with the transforming power of God’s love. 
We want to demonstrate God’s love, by meeting the practical and emotional needs of those around us. We want to run a series of initiatives and partner with other organisations, to help improve the lives of those in our city. By offering food, clothing, friendship and prayer, we want to fulfill our mission to see lives transformed. We believe the gospel of Jesus Christ, who died and rose 
again to give us eternal life. We believe the gospel is the power of God for the salvation of all who believe.
