We raise kingdom minded people
KingdomEdge Assembly was born to raise kingdom minded people, to propagate the undiluted message of God’s kingdom, to reach out to the unchurched, to express true love and care of Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ with passion for souls, prayer and ministry of the word. 
We believe God for unprecedented growth, with incredible commitment to seeing people’s lives transformed by the power of God’s love. We are convinced the best is yet to come! Whatever your age, background or culture, we hope you will feel at home with us.

What to Expect
We are a group of people tired of hypocrisy, striving to serve and worship God from a genuine heart. Expressing real love of our Lord Jesus which is very scarce in the body of Christ today. Spreading the good news of Christ with care, love and respect for people.
